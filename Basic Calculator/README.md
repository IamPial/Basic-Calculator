Basic Calculator with Variables & Data Types

A simple JavaScript-based calculator that uses variables to store results and demonstrates the basics of data types, arithmetic operations, and browser-based input/output.
Features

    Perform basic arithmetic operations:
       * Addition
       * Subtraction
       * Multiplication
       * Division
       * Modulus
    Uses prompt for input and console.log for output.
    Converts user input from strings to integers to handle calculations.
    Demonstrates the use of variables and arithmetic operators.

How It Works

    The calculator prompts the user to input two numbers using prompt.
    Converts the input from strings to integers using parseInt.
    Performs the following arithmetic operations:
        * Addition
        * Subtraction
        * Multiplication
        * Division
        * Modulus
    Outputs the results of these operations in the browser's developer console.
    
How to Run the Project

   1. Save the above files in a folder (e.g., basic-calculator).
   2. Open the index.html file in a browser.
   3. Open the developer console (usually accessible via F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I in most browsers).
   4. Enter the numbers as prompted, and view the results in the console.
     
Concepts Demonstrated

    1. Variables:
        Used to store numbers and results.
    2. Data Types:
        String (from prompt) and conversion to Number (using parseInt).
    3. Arithmetic Operators:
        +, -, *, /, % (modulus).
    4. Console Output:
        Results are logged using console.log.

# Basic Calculator 2

This is an updated version of the basic calculator project built with HTML and JavaScript. It allows users to perform fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation, with improved features.

## Features

- Input two numbers via prompts.
- Select an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`) for calculations.
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., non-numeric values or division by zero).
- Displays results dynamically on the webpage.

## Files

- **variables1.js**: JavaScript logic for handling input, validation, and calculations.
- **variables1.html**: HTML file that loads the JavaScript file and displays the results.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IamPial/basic-calculator-2.git

    Open the variables1.html file in any web browser.

    Use the prompts to:
        Enter two numbers.
        Choose an operator.

    The result will be displayed on the webpage.

Example Operations

    Addition: 5 + 3 = 8
    Subtraction: 10 - 7 = 3
    Multiplication: 4 * 6 = 24
    Division: 20 / 4 = 5
    Modulus: 10 % 3 = 1
    Exponentiation: 2 ** 3 = 8

Notes

    The calculator ensures input validation to avoid unexpected behavior.
    Division by zero displays an error message instead of a result.

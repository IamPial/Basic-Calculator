# Calculate Area of a Rectangle

This project demonstrates a simple JavaScript program that calculates the area of a rectangle. The user inputs the base and height values via prompts, and the program outputs the calculated area in the browser's console.

## Project Structure

- **`index.html`**: Contains the basic HTML structure and includes the JavaScript file.
- **`index.js`**: Contains the JavaScript code to calculate the rectangle's area.

## How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter the base and height of the rectangle.
2. The JavaScript code calculates the area using the formula:
   
   ```
   Area = Base x Height
   ```

3. The result is displayed in the console.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need a browser to run the HTML and JavaScript files. No additional tools are required.

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the files:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser.
3. Follow the prompts to input the base and height of the rectangle.
4. Check the console for the result.

### Example Output

If the base is `5` and the height is `10`, the console will display:
```
The area of rectangle is: 50
```
